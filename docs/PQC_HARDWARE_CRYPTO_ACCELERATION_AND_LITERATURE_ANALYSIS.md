## 1. Executive Overview

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardized in NIST FIPS 202, FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), and FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) introduces significant computational demands compared to classical public-key cryptography (RSA/ECC). These demands stem primarily from:
1. **High-dimensional polynomial arithmetic over finite rings** ($\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^n + 1)$), requiring frequent Number Theoretic Transforms (NTT/INTT) and high-density pointwise modular vector multiply-accumulate operations.
2. **Heavy symmetric cryptography**, specifically $\\text{Keccak-}f[1600]$ sponge permutations for pseudorandom matrix expansion, Centered Binomial Distribution (CBD) noise sampling, hashing, and rejection sampling.
3. **Strict side-channel and constant-time invariants**, requiring constant-shape control flow, arithmetic masking, and branchless implicit rejection key selection.

This document synthesizes contemporary academic literature and industry benchmarks regarding the AMD XDNA / AI Engine (AIE2) architecture, demonstrating why AMD XDNA represents an optimal, ultra-low-power hardware platform for 100% on-device PQC residency.

## 2. Microarchitectural Foundations of AMD XDNA / AIE2

### 2.1 Compute Engine & Vector Processing Density
As analyzed by **Ingonyama (Wu, 2023)** [1], the AMD XDNA (AIE-ML / AIE2) architecture differs fundamentally from conventional SIMD accelerators and GPUs. Each AIE2 processor tile contains:
- **A Dedicated 512-bit Vector Processing Unit (VPU)** paired with a 32-bit scalar RISC core in a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) execution model.
- **Peak Integer Arithmetic Throughput**: A single AIE2 tile can execute **64 operations of $16\text{b} \times 16\text{b} = 32\text{b}$ multiply-accumulates (MAC) per clock cycle**.
- **Dual-Issue VLIW Instruction Dispatch**: Allows parallel execution of vector MAC operations, memory load/store operations, and scalar address/pointer updates within a single clock cycle.

### 2.2 Memory Hierarchy & Interconnect
- **Tile-Local Data Memory (L1)**: Each tile contains 32 KiB of local high-bandwidth SRAM accessible in a single cycle.
- **Instruction Memory**: Dedicated 16 KiB program memory per core.
- **Streaming AIE Interconnect**: Non-blocking AXI-Stream interconnects with hardware flow control enable zero-copy, direct tile-to-tile FIFO queues (**ObjectFIFOs**).

| Metric | CPU (AVX-512) | Discrete GPU | AMD Phoenix NPU (AIE2 Array) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Typical Active Power** | 45 W – 105 W | 75 W – 350 W | **5 W – 15 W** [1] |
| **Integer MAC Density (16-bit)** | Medium | High | **Extremely High (64 MAC/cycle/tile)** [1] |
| **Inter-Stage Latency** | Memory-bound (L2/L3) | PCIe / Kernel Launch Overhead | **Zero-Copy Stream Interconnect (L1/ObjectFIFO)** |
| **Cryptographic Isolation** | Shared OS/User Space | Shared Compute Pipeline | **Dedicated Isolated NPU Hardware Plane** |

## 3. Key Acceleration Techniques from Literature

### 3.1 VLIW Carry-Save & Non-Blocking Modular Arithmetic
*Reference: Ohno, Shimamura, and Takamaeda-Yamazaki (arXiv:2502.11660, 2025)* [2]

In their study on accelerating high-density modular arithmetic on AMD Versal AI Engines, Ohno et al. demonstrated that conventional branch-based modular reductions cause severe pipeline stalls on VLIW/SIMD architectures. They proposed:
1. **Carry-Save Representation for Finite-Field Operations**: Deferring full carry propagation across consecutive multiply-accumulate operations, allowing intermediate terms to remain in unreduced redundant representation across SIMD registers.
2. **Branchless Barrett / Montgomery Multipliers**: Mapping modular reduction formulas directly into SIMD arithmetic instructions ($\lfloor (a \cdot m) / 2^k \rfloor$), eliminating pipeline bubbles.

**Application to phoenix-npu-pqc**:
In our NTT and polynomial multiplication kernels (
tt_multiply_accumulate_3, 
tt_multiply_accumulate_4, and ML-DSA matrix expansion), we employ branchless constant-time arithmetic (mod_mul, conjugate twiddle butterflies, and dual-pair BaseMul), ensuring constant execution latency regardless of secret key data.

### 3.2 Spatial Mapping & Streaming Dataflow Pipelining
*Reference: ScienceDirect / Future Generation Computer Systems (2025)* [3] & *arXiv:2502.11660* [2]

Both publications highlight that the primary bottleneck in hardware cryptographic acceleration is data movement between host memory and compute units. By partitioning long computation chains into **spatial tiles** connected via hardware stream FIFOs:
- **Intra-Task Parallelism**: Matrix rows and NTT stages are distributed across adjacent processor tiles.
- **Pipelined Execution**: While Tile $ completes matrix-vector multiplication for Row $, Tile +1$ immediately begins inverse NTT (INTT) and serialization on Row -1$.

**Application to phoenix-npu-pqc**:
Our multi-worker dataflow graphs (e.g., 5-worker ML-KEM-768 and 6-worker ML-KEM-1024) implement this exact spatial streaming paradigm:
\text{Noise Sampler (Tile 0)} \xrightarrow{\text{FIFO}} \text{Row}_0 \xrightarrow{\text{FIFO}} \text{Row}_1 \xrightarrow{\text{FIFO}} \text{Row}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{FIFO}} \text{Finalize (Tile 4)}
This eliminates all intermediate host DRAM round-trips.

### 3.3 Elimination of Host-to-Device Latency Overhead
*Reference: Tibrezus (HuggingFace / GitHub, 2024)* [4]

In the open-source *XDNA NPU Toolkit*, Tibrezus noted that running single, isolated kernel invocations (e.g., batch=1 GEMV) on Phoenix NPU resulted in higher latency than CPU execution due to the runtime dispatch overhead across the PCIe/XRT driver stack.

**Application to phoenix-npu-pqc**:
This empirical finding directly validates our **100% On-Device Residency Invariant**:
- The host CPU performs strictly **two DMA fills** (
equest + descriptor) at the start of an operation.
- **100% of cryptographic operations** (KDF, matrix expansion, noise sampling, NTT/INTT, decryption, re-encryption, ciphertext comparison, implicit rejection, CRC32 calculation) execute autonomously across the AIE2 tile array.
- The host receives strictly the **terminal sealed record**, completely avoiding host-to-device turnaround penalties.
